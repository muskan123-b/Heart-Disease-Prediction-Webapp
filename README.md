# Heart Disease Prediction
The aim of this project is to create a web app using streamlit library in python that help you find out whether you are at a risk of developing a heart disease or not.

# About Problem
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for one third of deaths in 2019. Heart disease cases nearly doubled over the period, from 271 million in 1990 to 523 million in 2019, and the number of heart disease deaths rose from 12.1 million to 18.6 million. The efficient and accurate and early medical diagnosis of heart disease plays a crucial role in taking preventive measures to prevent death.

# Dataset Used
Heart Disease Cleveland UCI dataset has been used in this project which is available on Kaggle.
The link of the dataset used is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci

There are 13 attributes in the dataset as follows.
age: age in years
sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type -- Value 0: typical angina -- Value 1: atypical angina -- Value 2: non-anginal pain -- Value 3: asymptomatic
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -- Value 0: upsloping -- Value 1: flat -- Value 2: downsloping
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect and the label
condition: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease

## Distribution of target variable
There are more people that do not have heart disease than those who have heart disease. Among 297, 47.13% cases are people with heart disease and 53.87% are people without heart disease.
